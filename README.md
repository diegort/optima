# Optima Coding Exercise

## Taken assumptions for the exercise

On one hand and although the app architecture is intended to be DDD, for simplicity and following the guidelines, it is as easy as possible so to store data I'm using a basic in memory collection. The proper implementation should use a repository to abstract the business logic about data access stuff.

On the other hand, it misses any presentation layer (Console, WCF, RestAPI, etc...), and it would be needed to get this code execuded in an application, but I think at this point it serves the purpose it was thought for.
